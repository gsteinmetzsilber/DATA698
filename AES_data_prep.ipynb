Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Others have different ideas. A great amount in the world today are using computers, some for work and some for the fun of it. Computers are one of man's greatest accomplishments. Computers are helpful in so many ways, including education, news, and live streams. Don't get me wrong, too many people spend time on the computer and they should be out interacting with others, but who are we to tell them what to do. When I grow up, I want to be an author or a journalist, and I know for a fact that both of those jobs involve lots of time on the computer, one more so than the other, but you know exactly what I'm getting at. So what if some experts think people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For all the expert knows, that's how most people make a living, and we don't know why people choose to use the computer for a great amount of time, and to be honest, it's none of my concern and it shouldn't be the so-called experts' concern. People interact a thousand times a day on the computers. Computers keep a lot of kids off the streets instead of being out and causing trouble. Computers help the FBI locate most wanted criminals. As you can see, computers are more useful to society than you think, computers benefit society.\"\"\"\n",

        "\n",
        "My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home. In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.

        "`` “The Mooring Mast” discusses how The Empire State Building, originally envisioned to be the world's tallest building, was conceived during a time of intense architectural rivalry, particularly with the Chrysler Building, which was under construction at the same time. The Chrysler Building's architect added a secret 185-foot spire, temporarily claiming the title for the tallest structure. This move spurred the Empire State Building's planners, led by former New York Governor Al Smith, to push the design even further, ultimately setting its new height at 1,250 feet.\n",
        "\n",
        "The increased height included an ambitious plan for a mooring mast at the top of the building, which was intended to serve as a docking station for dirigibles, or zeppelins. This feature was inspired by the growing interest in airship travel in the 1920s, which was seen as the future of transatlantic transportation. The dirigibles, large airships powered by engines and capable of carrying passengers in a gondola below, could theoretically dock at the Empire State Building, allowing passengers to embark and disembark right in the heart of Manhattan.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea was that the Empire State Building would not just be a static office building, but a dynamic transportation hub. It was to be equipped with facilities to handle airship passengers, including customs and ticketing areas on the 86th and 101st floors, effectively integrating the building into the emerging global travel network.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the practical realization of this vision faced numerous challenges. The architects and engineers had to consider how to securely anchor a thousand-foot-long dirigible without it posing a risk to the building and the city below. This required substantial modifications to the building's structure to handle the added stress of a moored airship, particularly in managing the forces exerted by winds at such a height.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the meticulous planning and consultation with experts, including tours of naval airship operations, the idea faced insurmountable hurdles. The greatest obstacle was the inherent dangers posed by the flammable hydrogen gas used by most dirigibles (helium, a safer alternative, was in scarce supply). The tragic destruction of the Hindenburg in 1937 underscored the potential risks of docking airships in densely populated areas and ultimately sounded the death knell for the mooring mast concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, natural factors such as the unpredictable and often violent winds at the top of the building made mooring safely a near impossibility. Legal restrictions on low-flying aircraft over populated areas further complicated the situation. While there were attempts to use the mast—like the Goodyear blimp Columbia's stunt of delivering newspapers—the practical use of the mooring mast for airship docking was never realized.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the late 1930s, with the rapid advancements in airplane technology, the age of the dirigible was coming to an end, rendering the mooring mast obsolete. The areas of the building designated for airship passengers were eventually repurposed for public use, including a high-altitude soda fountain and tea garden. The open observation deck, which was intended for airship passengers, has remained closed to the public.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building stands as a fascinating example of ambitious architectural planning that failed to materialize. It reflects the optimism and forward-thinking of an era that envisioned a future of airships integrating with the urban landscape. While the mast was never used for its intended purpose, it remains an iconic part of the New York City skyline and a testament to the audacious dreams of its creators. The story of the Empire State Building’s mooring mast is a poignant reminder of the limits of contemporary technology and the unpredictability of progress. ``\n",

        "My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home. In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\n",

        "        \"prompt\": \"\"\"Read \"The Mooring Mast\" by Marcia Amidon Lusted. Note: This is a concise summary of the full text that students are expected to read. The full text provides more detail and context, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding and response.\n",
        "        \"The Mooring Mast” discusses how The Empire State Building, originally envisioned to be the world's tallest building, was conceived during a time of intense architectural rivalry, particularly with the Chrysler Building, which was under construction at the same time. The Chrysler Building's architect added a secret 185-foot spire, temporarily claiming the title for the tallest structure. This move spurred the Empire State Building's planners, led by former New York Governor Al Smith, to push the design even further, ultimately setting its new height at 1,250 feet.\n",
        "The increased height included an ambitious plan for a mooring mast at the top of the building, which was intended to serve as a docking station for dirigibles, or zeppelins. This feature was inspired by the growing interest in airship travel in the 1920s, which was seen as the future of transatlantic transportation. The dirigibles, large airships powered by engines and capable of carrying passengers in a gondola below, could theoretically dock at the Empire State Building, allowing passengers to embark and disembark right in the heart of Manhattan.\n",
        "The idea was that the Empire State Building would not just be a static office building, but a dynamic transportation hub. It was to be equipped with facilities to handle airship passengers, including customs and ticketing areas on the 86th and 101st floors, effectively integrating the building into the emerging global travel network.\n",
        "However, the practical realization of this vision faced numerous challenges. The architects and engineers had to consider how to securely anchor a thousand-foot-long dirigible without it posing a risk to the building and the city below. This required substantial modifications to the building's structure to handle the added stress of a moored airship, particularly in managing the forces exerted by winds at such a height.\n",
        "Despite the meticulous planning and consultation with experts, including tours of naval airship operations, the idea faced insurmountable hurdles. The greatest obstacle was the inherent dangers posed by the flammable hydrogen gas used by most dirigibles (helium, a safer alternative, was in scarce supply). The tragic destruction of the Hindenburg in 1937 underscored the potential risks of docking airships in densely populated areas and ultimately sounded the death knell for the mooring mast concept.\n",
        "Additionally, natural factors such as the unpredictable and often violent winds at the top of the building made mooring safely a near impossibility. Legal restrictions on low-flying aircraft over populated areas further complicated the situation. While there were attempts to use the mast—like the Goodyear blimp Columbia's stunt of delivering newspapers—the practical use of the mooring mast for airship docking was never realized.\n",
        "By the late 1930s, with the rapid advancements in airplane technology, the age of the dirigible was coming to an end, rendering the mooring mast obsolete. The areas of the building designated for airship passengers were eventually repurposed for public use, including a high-altitude soda fountain and tea garden. The open observation deck, which was intended for airship passengers, has remained closed to the public.\n",
        "In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building stands as a fascinating example of ambitious architectural planning that failed to materialize. It reflects the optimism and forward-thinking of an era that envisioned a future of airships integrating with the urban landscape. While the mast was never used for its intended purpose, it remains an iconic part of the New York City skyline and a testament to the audacious dreams of its creators. The story of the Empire State Building’s mooring mast is a poignant reminder of the limits of contemporary technology and the unpredictability of progress.\n",
